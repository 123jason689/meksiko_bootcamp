Meksiko is a web-based inventory and sales data management application built with the Laravel framework. It provides a comprehensive solution for managing products, categories, and customer invoices. The system is designed with two distinct user roles: **Admin** for complete data management and **User** for Browse products and generating invoices.

This project was developed as a final project for the **BNCC Praetorian Recruitment Bootcamp**.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

  - **XAMPP:** A local server environment with Apache and MySQL.
  - **PHP 8.0+**
  - **Composer:** A dependency manager for PHP.
  - **Node.js & NPM:** For managing front-end dependencies.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/meksiko_bootcamp.git
    cd meksiko_bootcamp
    ```

2.  **Install PHP Dependencies**

    ```sh
    composer install
    ```

3.  **Install JavaScript Dependencies**
    Use NPM to install front-end packages.

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Set Up Environment File**

      - Duplicate the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`.
      - Open your XAMPP control panel and start the **Apache** and **MySQL** services.
      - Open `phpMyAdmin` and create a new database. A good name would be `meksiko_db`.
      - Update your `.env` file with your database credentials:
        ```env
        DB_CONNECTION=mysql
        DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
        DB_PORT=3306
        DB_DATABASE=meksiko_db
        DB_USERNAME=root
        DB_PASSWORD=
        ```

5.  **Generate Application Key**
    This key is used for encryption and is essential for security.

    ```sh
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

6.  **Run Database Migrations and Seed Data**
    This command will create all necessary tables and populate the database with dummy data for products and categories.

    ```sh
    php artisan migrate --seed
    ```

7.  **Create Storage Link**
    This makes the `storage/app/public` directory accessible from the web to display uploaded images.

    ```sh
    php artisan storage:link
    ```

8.  **Compile Front-end Assets**

    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

9.  **Start the Development Server**

    ```sh
    php artisan serve
    ```

    You can now access the application at **[suspicious link removed]**.

## üë§ Admin & User Accounts

  - **Admin Account:** Per the project requirements, admin accounts must be created manually through the database. You can do this by adding a new user in the `users` table and then adding their `user_id` to the `admins` table.
  - **User Account:** You can register a new user account directly from the application's `/register` page.
